Hey there! 👋

I'm MrDawkin, a Junior DevOps Engineer based in Poland.

In my day-to-day work, I operate and maintain production systems, with a strong focus on backups, restores, automation, and system reliability.
I work across Linux and Windows environments, containerized services using Docker, and automation with Bash and cron.

I'm actively learning cloud technologies on my own and applying cloud-native concepts such as infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and container orchestration in personal projects.

My background in Electronics and Applied Computer Science gives me a solid foundation in software engineering and system-level thinking.
I also have experience with data analysis and machine learning, which helps me better understand modern AI-driven workloads deployed in the cloud.

Pinned repositories below showcase my learning path in cloud and DevOps.

Fun facts:
- Big fan of Star Wars 🌌 (yes, the infrastructure must be resilient like the Death Star but better designed)
- LEGO Star Wars enthusiast 🧱
- I enjoy automating repetitive tasks more than doing them manually
